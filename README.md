# This is my configuration of neovim with lua
Why transfer to Neovim from Vim? Because my Vim using YouCompleteme and Tagbar
is unbearablly slow in my laptop. Especially when I change buffer with CTRL-n
and CTRL-p. Maybe it is because my laptop is trash?

I am looking for a minimal setting for my vim editor. I need it to response
quicklly. Now it is a hard work for me.

I don't want to waste too much time to configure my Vim/Neovim like before. I
would like to use the time to coding!
